## Why to Use

### CONCEPT OF METAMIND PLUGIN
At Metamind, we have realised that the best way to maintain your Roam Graph is by reviewing your work after every creative bout. The plugin will help you journal and plan your future work in the [[M/Update Logs]] page and structure your nodes into consolidated structures or a Hierarchy on [[M/Graph Home]] page.

The creative bout can be the end of a day, week, sprint, or simply a single work session.

**Use the plugin to Review, Consolidate and Save your Graph.** See *HOW TO USE* below!

### ABOUT METAMIND COMPANY

We are inspired by Content Graphs as a one-stop shop for all consumed and created content by a person. We want the content to not be bucketed by a platform’s medium of choice but by a person: [People are](https://davidphelps.substack.com/p/people-are-the-new-platforms) the New Platforms!](https://davidphelps.substack.com/p/people-are-the-new-platforms).

**After INSTALL, simply go back to doing your work on the graph. Then when you wish...**

**STEP 1/2: Tap “Review” on the top bar to generate a new `update log` for the work you did since INSTALL or the last Saved State.** For our V1, Update Log gives you New and Modified Pages with new Content and also, Daily Page Entries and Renamed Pages, since the last Saved State. You will also see all the new nodes mentioned in the update at the bottom of the [[M/Graph Home]] that you can structure accordingly in your Graph Home.

**STEP 2/3: Go to the latest Update Log on the [[M/Update Logs]] page. Simultaneously, make changes to your [[M/Graph Home]] in the sidebar.**

**STEP 3/3: Tap “Save” on the top bar once you’re done with both pages.**

*Note: Everything happens locally. We only record the time-stamp for the last saved state to our servers. Enter the API Token below to allow yourself and your peers to privately or publicly access the graph through the Metamind App and make the plugin work much faster.*
