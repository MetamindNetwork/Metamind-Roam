# Metamind-Roam

A Roam Research plugin that helps the users to sync/publish the graph on Metamind platform. This plugin has an additional advantage
where the users can generate:

1. Index Page - A page listing all the pages in reverse chronological order.
2. Update Log - A page that categorizes each of the pages as New Pages, Modified Pages and Rename Pages.

Hence the users can maintain a `change log` of their graph.
