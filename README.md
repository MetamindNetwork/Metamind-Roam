## Why to Use

### CONCEPT OF METAMIND PLUGIN
At Metamind, we have realised that the best way to maintain your Roam Graph is by reviewing your work after every creative bout. **The plugin will help you journal and plan your future work on the [[M/Update Logs]] page and organise your pages into consolidated structures or a Hierarchy on [[M/Graph Home]] page.**

The creative bout can be the end of a day, week, sprint, or simply a single work session.

**Use the plugin to Review, Consolidate and Save your Graph.** See *HOW TO USE* below!

### ABOUT METAMIND COMPANY

We are inspired by Content Graphs as a one-stop shop for all consumed and created content by a person. We want the content to not be bucketed by a platform’s medium of choice but by a person: [People are the New Platforms!](https://davidphelps.substack.com/p/people-are-the-new-platforms).

**After completing SETUP on the plugin page, simply go back to doing your work on the graph. Then whenever you wish...**

**STEP 1/3: Tap “Review” on the ROAM App's top bar to generate a new update log for the work you did since INSTALL or the last Saved State.**
For our Version 1, the latest entry in the [[M/Update Logs]] page gives you all the New and Modified Pages with new Content. It also gives you Daily Page Entries and Renamed Pages, _since _the _last__ Saved State_.*
You will also see all the new nodes mentioned in the update at the bottom of the [[M/Graph Home]] that you can structure accordingly in your Graph Home.

**STEP 2/3: Review the newly created Update Log. Simultaneously, make changes to your [[M/Graph Home]] open in the sidebar.**

**STEP 3/3: Tap “Save” on the top bar once you’re done with both pages.**

***Note: Everything happens locally.** We only record the time-stamp for the last saved state to our servers. You can enter the Graph API Token (with Read Access) in the Plugin page to allow yourself and your peers to privately or publicly access the graph through the Metamind App and make the plugin work much faster.*
