**HOW TO USE**

After you install the plugin,
- STEP 1 is to click the Generate New Update Log and Index Page button to create an Index Page and Update Log page in your Graph.

- Then STEP 2 is to Sync Graph with Metamind Servers button to send us graph in it’s current state.

And finally, you can start making changes to your graph : add pages, modify pages and rename pages. And whenever you want to pause and see a log of all the updates you have made, repeat Step 1 and Step 2 and so on you go...

## WHY TO USE

### CONCEPT OF METAMIND PLUGIN

At Metamind, we realise that it’s better to pause and see an overall picture of the work you have done into your graph in the last sprint, then to simply get a mindless stream of all updates, of every little movement that happened in your graph. And hence, we have created this plugin for you to generate reports of the work you have created at meaningful intervals.

### METAMIND APP FOR GRAPH PUBLISHING (coming soon)

We are soon coming out with a Metamind App, where you will be able to share your graph with subscribers who will be able to follow along these update logs as you grow your graph and create more content. Mail us here to get a sneak-peak of what their experience will look like : hi@metamind.network.
