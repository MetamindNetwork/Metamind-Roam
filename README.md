# Metamind Roam

## NEED TO KNOW

**After doing the SETUP as mentioned in (How To Use). You use this plugin to help you meaningfully track your activity on your Roam Graph.**

**With every cycle of (1/2) Generate Update Log, Edit Update Log as per your liking [[M/Update Logs]] and then (2/2) Sync Graph, you get a report of what work you did after every creative bout.**

**In V1, the plugin serves you all the New, Modified and Renamed Pages, since the last sync.**

## HOW TO USE

Setup by entering the API Token from the graph and hitting Sync Graph. You may go back to working on your graph. From now on, whenever you want to catalogue your work,

- STEP 1 is to click the Generate New Update Log and Index Page button to create an Index Page and Update Log page in your Graph.
- Then edit the generated Update Log to capture, with all your comments and story, the work you did on your graph.
- Then STEP 2 is to click `Sync Graph with Metamind Servers` button to send us the graph in it’s current state.

And so, you can start making changes to your graph. And whenever you want to pause and see a log of all the updates you have made, repeat Steps 1, 2 and 3 and so on you go...

## WHY TO USE

#### CONCEPT OF METAMIND PLUGIN

At Metamind, we realise that it’s better to pause and catalogue an overall picture of the work you have done into your graph in the latest sprint. This is better than simply getting a mindless stream of all updates, of every little movement that happened in your graph. Hence, we have created this plugin for you to generate reports of the work you have created at meaningful intervals you choose.
